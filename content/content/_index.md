# Transit Gateway, a walkthrough

This workshop shows how to setup communication between multiple VPCs and On-premise resources in our Datacenter. We will explore how we can have different routing policies for different environments such as Non-production and production.

Next, we will make sure that we can easily communicate using DNS names vs IP addresses, without having to deploy and manage Virtual DNS servers on EC2. Finally, we will explore how resources in Multiple AWS accounts can communicate.
