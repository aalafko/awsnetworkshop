## Access Strong Swan using AWS Cloud9 Environment

In order to access and work on the Datacenter router, we will use AWS Cloud9. Cloud 9 is an IDE platform that is managed as a service for us. We will be using just a fraction of its capability. But this intro should give you some ideas how you can provide a shared environment for managing your Infrastructure as code development.

1. In the AWS Management Console change to the region you are working in. This is in the upper right hand drop down menu.

1. In the AWS Management Console choose **Services** then select **Cloud9**.

1. From **Your Environments** page click the **Open IDE** button on the Workshop Environment Box.

1. This will bring up the Cloud9 Console and download the github repo to your working folder.

1. From the **file** menu select **Upload Local Files...** and click **Select files** button, navigate to the key file you created earlier. _note: it should have a .pem extension_.

1. In the main panel click the **x** sign next to the **welcome** tab to close this tab.

1. In the main panel click the **+** sign and launch a **New Terminal**. This is a bash shell on the Cloud9 Instance.

1. Move the key to the .ssh folder: `mv _key_name_.pem ~/.ssh/`

1. Restrict access to the key file: `chmod 400 ~/.ssh/_key_name_.pem`

1. From another browser tab, again navigate to the Management Console and choose **Services** then select **CloudFormation**.

1. From the left-hand menu, select **Exports** in the left hand menu and find the export for ssh to the StrongSwan: DC1-_stack-name_-Swanssh, ssh and copy the **Export value**

1. Back on the **Cloud9** Browser tab paste this into the bash shell. _note: in the command you will notice the -i reference to the pem file you just copied, this is the private half of the key pair. The public key is on the Strong Swan Box_. Answer **yes** to **Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?**

1. You now are connected to the Strong Swan Box in the Datacenter VPC. We will be configuring the Strong Swan VPN and Quagga router.

1. Lets look at the VPN configuration file ``sudo cat /etc/strongswan/ipsec.conf``, you will see place holders like {PRIVATE_IP}, {PUBLIC_IP}, TUNNEL_1_IP and TUNNEL_2_IP, we will change them later on.
