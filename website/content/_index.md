### What to expect

This Networking workshop shows how to setup communication between multiple VPCs and on-premise resources in our Datacenter.

Within your own AWS account, you can explore how a scalable hybrid network works with Transit Gateway, VPN, Route 53 Resolver, and VPC Endpoints.

Instead of connecting back to a real Datacenter, however, we will mock up a Datacenter in AWS. Using Cisco and Juniper to emulate VPN connectivty from Datacenters and Bind Server for the Datacenter DNS.
